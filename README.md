# FastFlash
This project was designed during Full-Stack development course. 

## Functionnalities
This application helps students learning different languages through flashcards. By clicking on the card, the traduction appears and by clicking again, the card is flipped and another card appears. When all cards have been flipped, the application offers the possibility to go through all the cards again, but this time the word and traduction have been switched. 

A new card can be added. 

The application only offers the possibility to learn english for now.
